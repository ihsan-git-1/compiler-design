# Compiler Design Project: Dart and Flutter 

# Introduction
Welcome to the Compiler Design project that combines Dart and Flutter compilers with navigation features, HTML generation from Flutter, and integration of the ANTLR 4 parser generator. This comprehensive project aims to provide not only a powerful compiler system for Dart and Flutter but also enhanced parsing capabilities using ANTLR 4, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

# Features
## Dart Compiler:

Converts Dart source code into intermediate representation.
Performs lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and semantic analysis.
Generates optimized intermediate code.

# Flutter :
Compiles Flutter source code into executable binaries.
Supports the Flutter framework's unique features and widgets.
Integrates with the Dart compiler to handle Flutter-Dart interdependencies.
Navigation System:

Implements a navigation system to facilitate code exploration.
Enables users to navigate through the codebase efficiently.
Supports features like code jumping, finding references, and more.
# HTML Generation from Flutter:

Transforms Flutter code into HTML representations.
Facilitates web-based Flutter application development.
Provides a seamless transition between Flutter and web development.
# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):

Constructs a detailed AST representation of the code.
Allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the code structure.
Aids in optimization, transformation, and other compiler-related tasks.
Optimization Techniques:

Includes various optimization strategies for generated code.
Focuses on improving runtime performance and reducing resource usage.
